# emergency-siren-classification

In this project, we aim to develop an ML-based algorithm for the classification of emergency sounds. 

 Sounds we aim to classify include: 
 - firetruck sirens
 - ambulance sirens
 - fire alarms
 - loud noises indicative of danger

This algorithm will be applied to a wearable device that will alert deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals of environmental dangers through various patterns of tactile feedback.
